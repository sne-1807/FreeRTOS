# FreeRTOS Learning Documentation
## Introduction
* This repository serves as a place where I can document and organise my learning journey in FreeRTOS. Starting from the basics, I am working my way towards implementing FreeRTOS in an projects for enhanced multitasking and computational efficiency when running complex programs

## Topics Covered:
* I will be updating it as I make progress, but here is a list of topics I have covered so far:
    1.  SysTick Timer and Time Slicing
    2. Basic Multitasking Implementation as Round Robin Scheduling (without RTOS kernel running)
